Given the detailed scenario you've described, where even the standard AWS Lambda service logs (INIT_START and START request logs) are missing, it suggests a few specific issues that could be occurring:

1. Lambda Service-Level Interruption
Lambda Internal Issue: Rarely, AWS Lambda itself might encounter an internal error or temporary glitch that prevents the function from starting properly. This might happen at a very early stage before the INIT_START or START logs are generated. Such issues are usually transient and might be related to the underlying infrastructure.
2. Resource Allocation Failures
Resource Limits: If your Lambda function cannot allocate the necessary resources (e.g., memory or compute capacity) due to high concurrency or system limits being reached, it might fail to start properly. This kind of failure often happens silently from the user's perspective.
Throttling: AWS Lambda has concurrency limits. If your function hits these limits, additional invocations might be throttled. Normally, throttling errors are logged, but in edge cases or due to timing, logs might not be generated.
3. VPC Configuration Issues
Network Connectivity: If your Lambda function is configured to run within a VPC and there are issues with the VPC configuration (such as subnets or security groups not correctly set up, or lack of ENI availability), it might prevent the function from initializing properly. While this typically results in an error log, in rare cases, it might interfere early enough to prevent any logging.
4. Cold Start Anomalies
Cold Start Bug: In very rare situations, there could be a bug or a temporary issue with the AWS infrastructure during the cold start process. This could interrupt the normal logging process before it even begins.
Troubleshooting Steps
AWS Support: Since the usual debugging steps (like checking permissions, configurations, etc.) have been ruled out, consider contacting AWS Support. This kind of issue might require insights from AWS internal logs that are not exposed to customers.
Monitoring and Alerts: Set up detailed monitoring and alerts using CloudWatch Metrics and Alarms. Look for metrics related to throttles, errors, and other invocation metrics that might indicate when and why these failures occur.
Review Changes: Check if there were any recent changes in your Lambda function, AWS Lambda configurations, or VPC settings that correlate with when these issues began.
Experimentation:
Isolation Test: Try to replicate the issue in a different AWS region or with a new Lambda function that has similar settings. This can help identify if the issue is specific to a region, account, or configuration.
Incremental Changes: Gradually change one setting at a time in a controlled environment to see if you can identify a specific trigger for the issue.
Logs and X-Ray: Enable AWS X-Ray for more detailed diagnostic information. Although you've mentioned that logging is already extensive, double-check that X-Ray traces might capture additional details not available in CloudWatch Logs.
By systematically approaching the problem with these steps, you should be able to gather more information that will hopefully lead to resolving why some Lambda invocations fail to produce even the initial AWS logs.
