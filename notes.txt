Your willingness to experiment with new approaches and technologies is a testament to your innovative mindset. I greatly admire your out-of-the-box thinking – it’s a valuable asset to our team.
Congratulations on getting dbt certified and earning the Hashicorp Certified Terraform Associate certification this year. These achievements highlight your commitment to continuous learning and staying ahead in your field.
Start:

Given your skills and positive attitude, I encourage you to consider taking on more leadership roles. You have the potential to be an excellent leader. If leadership is a path you’re interested in, maybe start delving into leadership-focused reading and learning. It could provide you with great insights and tools for the future.
Stop:

I suggest moving away from updating our dashboard manually. Automating it end-to-end will be a significant efficiency gain for us. It's a project that aligns well with your skill set and could be a great opportunity to apply your knowledge.
Working with you has always been a fantastic experience, Josh. Your intelligence, friendliness, and ability to keep up with rapidly evolving technology trends make you an invaluable member of our team. I’m excited to see your continued growth and the innovative solutions you’ll bring to our future projects.
