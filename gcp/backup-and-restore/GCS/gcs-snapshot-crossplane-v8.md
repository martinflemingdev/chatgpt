# GCP GCS Bucket Snapshot Retention and Restore Strategy (with Crossplane)

üìö **[Google Cloud Docs: Protection, Backup, and Recovery Overview](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/protection-backup-recovery-overview)**

This document describes how to configure snapshot-like behavior and backup retention strategies for GCS buckets using Crossplane and native GCP features.

## Object Versioning

üìö [Docs](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/object-versioning)

Tracks and preserves older versions of objects when overwritten or deleted.

- **Default**: `false`

### Crossplane Example
```yaml
versioning:
  enabled: true
```

---

## Soft Delete Policy

üìö [Docs](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/soft-delete)

Keeps deleted objects in a restorable state for a configurable number of seconds.

- **Default**: `604800` seconds (7 days)

### Custom Example:
```yaml
softDeletePolicy:
  retentionDurationSeconds: 1209600  # 14 days
```

---

## Retention Policy

üìö [Docs](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/bucket-lock)

Enforces a minimum retention duration to prevent modification or deletion.

- **Default**: not set

### Crossplane Example
```yaml
retentionPolicy:
  retentionPeriod: 2592000  # 30 days
```

---

## Lifecycle Rules

üìö [Docs](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/lifecycle)

Automates the deletion or transition of object versions to manage storage cost and age-based policies.

- **Default**: not configured

### Crossplane Example
```yaml
lifecycleRules:
  - action:
      type: Delete
    condition:
      age: 30
      isLive: false
```

---

## Dual-Region Storage

üìö [Docs](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/locations#dual-regions)

Stores data in two distinct regions to provide high availability and resilience.

### Predefined Dual-Region Options

| Dual-Region Name | Region Pair                                 | Description              |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------|--------------------------|
| `ASIA1`          | `asia-northeast1` + `asia-northeast2`        | Tokyo + Osaka            |
| `EUR4`           | `europe-north1` + `europe-west4`             | Finland + Netherlands    |
| `EUR5`           | `europe-west1` + `europe-west2`              | Belgium + London         |
| `EUR7`           | `europe-west2` + `europe-west3`              | London + Frankfurt       |
| `EUR8`           | `europe-west3` + `europe-west6`              | Frankfurt + Z√ºrich       |
| `NAM4`           | `us-central1` + `us-east1`                   | Iowa + South Carolina    |

### Crossplane Example (Predefined)
```yaml
location: nam4
```

### Crossplane Example (Configurable Dual-Region)
```yaml
customPlacementConfig:
  dataLocations:
    - australia-southeast1
    - australia-southeast2
```

## Cross-Bucket Replication

üìö [Docs](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/replication)

This feature allows **asynchronous replication** of data from one bucket to another, potentially in a different region. It's useful for:
- Creating geographically redundant backups
- Offloading access to regional copies
- Disaster recovery planning

- **Default**: not enabled
- **Crossplane Support**: ‚ùå Not supported in the GCP storage provider

To configure, use the Console, API, or `gcloud` CLI.

---

## Turbo Replication

üìö [Docs](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/turbo-replication)

Turbo Replication is available **only for dual-region buckets**. It ensures that data written to one region is **replicated to the second region within 15 minutes (RPO of 15 mins)**.

Use cases:
- Low RPO requirements (e.g., regulated industries)
- Business continuity across regions

- **Default**: Disabled
- **Crossplane Support**: ‚ùå Not supported; enable via Console/API

---

```yaml
apiVersion: storage.gcp.upbound.io/v1beta2
kind: Bucket
metadata:
  name: snapshot-enabled-bucket
  labels:
    environment: production
    owner: platform-team
spec:
  forProvider:
    location: nam4
    storageClass: STANDARD

      retentionDurationSeconds: 1209600
    retentionPolicy:
      retentionPeriod: 2592000
    lifecycleRules:
      - action:
          type: Delete
        condition:
          age: 30
          isLive: false
  providerConfigRef:
    name: gcp-provider

## Restore Strategy Summary

| Scenario                          | Restore Approach                               |
|----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Soft-deleted object              | Restore via Console or GCS API                 |
| Prior version (versioned)        | Use `gsutil cp gs://bucket/obj#<gen>`          |
| Lifecycle-deleted object         | Not recoverable unless backed up elsewhere     |
| Replicated object (manual setup) | Copy from destination bucket                   |

---

## Summary

Crossplane can declaratively manage most GCS backup features including versioning, soft deletes, retention, lifecycle cleanup, and dual-region replication. Advanced features like Turbo Replication and Cross-Bucket Replication require manual setup using the GCP Console or API.
