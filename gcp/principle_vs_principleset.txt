principal://... vs principalSet://...

Format	Meaning	Typical Use Case
principal://...	A single identity (one subject) in a Workload Identity Pool	Used to grant permissions to one federated identity
principalSet://...	A set of identities (matching an attribute pattern, like AWS role) in a Pool	Used to grant permissions to multiple identities, often by attribute match
‚úÖ When to use which
üßç Use principal:// when:
You want to grant a GCP IAM role to a specific federated identity ‚Äî e.g., one AWS role or one OIDC subject:

member: "principal://iam.googleapis.com/projects/123456789/locations/global/workloadIdentityPools/my-pool/subject/abc@def"
üë• Use principalSet:// when:
You want to grant a GCP IAM role to a group of federated identities that match some attribute, like all roles in an AWS account or a specific AWS role:

member: "principalSet://iam.googleapis.com/projects/123456789/locations/global/workloadIdentityPools/my-pool/attribute.aws_role/arn:aws:iam::111122223333:role/MyRole"
Or broader:

member: "principalSet://iam.googleapis.com/projects/123456789/locations/global/workloadIdentityPools/my-pool/attribute.aws_role/arn:aws:iam::111122223333:role/*"
This one covers all roles in that AWS account.

üö® Important Note
Both formats are valid in Crossplane as long as the underlying GCP IAM API accepts them.

They are not interchangeable because:

principal:// is a specific identity

principalSet:// is a pattern matcher or group

So they serve different purposes.
